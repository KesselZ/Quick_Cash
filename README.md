# Quick_Cash

Quick Cash is a simple application that could run on Android. In this application, users could push their task or take the job that others pushed to earn money.

The function I have achieved: 
1.Log in/log out
2.Push a task/job
3.Take a task/job
4.Locate jobs by Google Map
5.Chat with other user
6.Search for a task/job
7.View the "search history"

This is a project that connect the google firebase, to use it, please reinitialize your own firebase.
